## üöÄ Quick Start

## üìã Configuration

### Basic Configuration (config.toml)

```toml
# Database Configuration
[clickhouse]
url = "http://uptime_user:uptime_password@localhost:8123/uptime_monitor"

# Server Configuration
[server]
port = 3000

# Logging Configuration
[logger]
level = 4  # 0=silent, 7=verbose

[selfMonitoring]
# Enable self-monitoring and automatic backfill
enabled = true

# ID of the self-monitor
id = "self-monitor"

# Health check interval in seconds (default: 3)
# Lower values detect outages faster but increase database load
interval = 3

# Backfill synthetic pulses for monitors that were healthy before downtime
# This prevents false downtime reports when the monitoring system itself is down
backfillOnRecovery = true

# Strategy for synthetic pulse latency:
# - "last-known": Use the last latency from before the downtime
# - "null": Don't set latency for synthetic pulses
latencyStrategy = "last-known"

# Monitor Definition
[[monitors]]
id = "api-prod"
name = "Production API"
token = "secure-random-token"
interval = 60  # Expect pulse every 60 seconds
maxRetries = 3
resendNotification = 5
notificationChannels = ["critical"]

# Group Definition
[[groups]]
id = "production"
name = "Production Services"
strategy = "any-up"  # UP if any child is up
degradedThreshold = 90
notificationChannels = ["critical"]

# Status Page
[[status_pages]]
id = "public"
name = "Service Status"
slug = "status"
items = ["production"]

# Notifications

# Critical Discord Notifications
[notifications.channels.critical]
id = "critical"
name = "Critical Production Alerts"
enabled = true

[notifications.channels.critical.discord]
enabled = true
webhookUrl = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
username = "üö® Critical Alert Bot"

[notifications.channels.critical.discord.mentions]

# Critical Email Notifications
[notifications.channels.critical.email]
enabled = true
from = '"Rabbit Company" <info@rabbit-company.com>'
to = [""]

[notifications.channels.critical.email.smtp]
host = "mail.rabbit-company.com"
port = 465
secure = true
user = "info@rabbit-company.com"
pass = ""
```

## üì° Sending Pulses

### Manual Pulse Sending

The pulse endpoint (`/v1/push/:token`) accepts the following optional query parameters:

- **`latency`** - Response time in milliseconds (capped at 600000ms/10 minutes)
- **`startTime`** - When the check started (ISO format or Unix timestamp)
- **`endTime`** - When the check completed (ISO format or Unix timestamp)

#### Timing Logic

- If both `startTime` and `endTime` are provided, latency is calculated automatically
- If `startTime` and `latency` are provided, `endTime` is calculated
- If `endTime` and `latency` are provided, `startTime` is calculated
- If only `latency` is provided, `endTime` is set to current time and `startTime` is calculated
- If no parameters are provided, the pulse is recorded with the current timestamp

#### Examples

```bash
# Simple pulse with no timing data
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/push/:token

# Send a pulse with latency (milliseconds)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/push/:token?latency=125.5

# RECOMMENDED: Send all three parameters for maximum accuracy
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/push/:token?startTime=2025-10-15T10:00:00Z&endTime=2025-10-15T10:00:01.500Z&latency=1500

# Send a pulse with start and end times (latency calculated automatically)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/push/:token?startTime=2025-10-15T10:00:00Z&endTime=2025-10-15T10:00:01Z

# Send a pulse with Unix timestamps
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/push/:token?startTime=1736928000000&endTime=1736928001500

# Send a pulse with start time and latency (end time calculated)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/push/:token?startTime=2025-10-15T10:00:00Z&latency=1500
```

### Automated Pulse Sending

For automated pulse sending we recommend using [PulseMonitor](https://github.com/Rabbit-Company/PulseMonitor).
